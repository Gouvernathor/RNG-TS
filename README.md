# RNG-TS

Provides a deterministic and reseedable pseudorandom number generator, with many utility functions similar to those of Python's `random` module - but not with a compatible API.

The Mersenne-Twister implementation is adapted from Jonas Hermsmeier's [rng.js](https://github.com/jhermsmeier/rng.js/blob/master/lib/mersenne-twister.js), licensed under the MIT license.
